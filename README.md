<h3> Course Description </h3>
2 credits <br/>
Prerequisites: CG 111 or permission of the instructor <br/>
Processing is used to present concepts such as variables, functions, objects, data flow and control. Techniques such as Basic drawing primitives, animations, interactive graphics, as well as logic flow and project management are explored.
<br/>

By the end of the course, students should have a grasp on: <br/>
<ul>
<li>Understanding the fundamentals of controlling the computer through code</li>
<li>Object oriented approaches to programming</li>
<li>The syntax of the programming language <em>Processing</em></li>
<li>Different types of data structures and data flows</li>
<li>How to utilize user input</li>
<li>How to utilize multimedia in their programming</li>
<li>Develop critical skills around user Interaction and user experience </li>
</ul>

<h3>Policies, etc </h3>

<b>Attendance: </b>Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class. Students who come in later than 30 minutes after the class started will be marked absent.
3 unexcused latenesses = one absence 
3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-)
More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade.
</br>

<b>Evaluation: </b>Students are evaluated on completetion and quality of assignments, homework assignments, class participation and attendance. Points will be deducted for late assignments and homework. <br/>
<ul>
  <li>Participation and Attendance - 20%</li>
  <li>Weekly homework assignments - 30%</li>
  <li>Midterm Project - 20%</li>
  <li>Final Project - 30%</li>
</ul>

Assignments will be posted on GitHub with URLs submitted via Blackboard. Grades and comments will be posted on Blackboard. 5% will be deducted per late assignment per day. 
<br/>

<b>Computer/Classroom etiquette:</b> Students are expected to refrain from using the computer during class presentations and discussions. Students will need to be working using a computer, but <a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.sxywlun1f">this is worth a read</a>.


<h3>Software</h3>

We will be coding purely in <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>.
GitHub will be used to post assignments.

<h3>Required Textbook</h3>

<em><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920000570.do">Getting Started with Processing Casey Reas & Ben Fry</a></em>
Oâ€™Reilly
2010

<h3>Resources</h3>

Tutorials and readings will be posted here on weekly class notes. Besides the textbook, if you prefer to learn through video, you may find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?sort=dd&view=50&shelf_id=2" target="_blank">Dan Shiffman's Processing tutorials</a> very helpful and funny. Also, it's handy to have the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/" target="_blank">Processing reference</a> handy while coding.
