<h3>Policies, etc </h3>

<b>Attendance: </b>Attendance will be taken at the beginning of each class. Students who come in later than 30 minutes after the class started will be marked absent.
3 unexcused latenesses = one absence 
3 unexcused absences = one half grade decrease (e.g. an A becomes an A-)
More than 3 unexcused absences a student will receive a failing grade.
</br>

<b>Evaluation: </b>Students are evaluated on completetion and quality of assignments, homework assignments, class participation and attendance. Points will be deducted for late assignments and homework. <br/>
<ul>
  <li>Participation and Attendance - 20%</li>
  <li>Weekly homework assignments - 30%</li>
  <li>Midterm Project - 20%</li>
  <li>Final Project - 30%</li>
</ul>

Assignments will be posted on GitHub with URLs submitted via Blackboard. Grades and comments will be posted on Blackboard. 5% will be deducted per late assignment per day. Homework and assignments must be handed in by 12:00am the day of class (so Tuesday night).
<br/>

<b>Computer/Classroom etiquette:</b> Students are expected to refrain from using the computer during class presentations and discussions. Students will need to be working using a computer, but <a href="https://medium.com/@cshirky/why-i-just-asked-my-students-to-put-their-laptops-away-7f5f7c50f368#.sxywlun1f">this is worth a read</a>.


<h3>Software</h3>

We will be coding purely in <a href="https://processing.org/" target="_blank">Processing</a>.
GitHub will be used to post assignments.

<h3>Resources</h3>

Tutorials and readings will be posted here on weekly class notes. Besides the textbook, if you prefer to learn through video, you may find <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?sort=dd&view=50&shelf_id=2" target="_blank">Dan Shiffman's Processing tutorials</a> very helpful and funny. Also, it's handy to have the <a href="https://processing.org/reference/" target="_blank">Processing reference</a> handy while coding.
